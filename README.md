### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a technology lover, fascinated by innovation and software development. More specifically, I am interested in web development, mobile development and software architecture, code design.

Right now, I am working as developer and research in a project for Instituto de Medicina Tropical (UFRN), but I also work as a developer on personal projects, using,  for example, Flutter and Spring boot.
