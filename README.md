### Hi there 

I am a technology lover, fascinated by innovation and software development. More specifically, I am interested in web development, mobile development, software architecture, agile software development.

Right now, I am working as developer and research in a project for Instituto de Metr√≥pole Digital (UFRN), but I also work as a developer on personal projects, using,  for example, Flutter and Spring boot.
